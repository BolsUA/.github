# BolsUA, a Scholarship Platform for University of Aveiro

## Current Problems
- **Limited Accessibility**: UA scholarships can only be found through the UA News website, which lacks visibility and reach.
- **No Filtering Options**: The UA News website does not provide any options to filter scholarships by specific criteria, making the search process inefficient.
- **Manual Application Process**: The entire scholarship application process is currently handled through email.
- **Fragmented Document Management**: Required application documents are scattered across different pages, making it difficult for applicants to gather everything they need.
- **Lack of Centralization**: There is no centralized platform where all scholarships are published and managed.
